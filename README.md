# libary-alura
<h1>What is about</h1>
<p>In this chalenger we was requested to make like a "libary" manegement using our know about 
SptingBoot and using this <a href = "https://gutendex.com/">API</a> to donwload the data about the books and Authors</p>
<h1>Troubles that I had</h1>
<h2>First</h2>
<p>My main trouble was to save books and outhors. Frist I was thinking about to use the relacion Many to Many
however, this type of relation was harder tham I thought so I decided to use OneToMany, and get only the first Author</p>
<h2>Second</h2>
<p>Becouse of the way that the <a href = "https://gutendex.com/">API</a> send the data (they send authors inseide the books)
was a kind of difficult. But with a few condicionals and one try catch, I was able to make it</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>For sure, Spring Boot is amazing, it make very simple a lot of stuff, like sabe on a DataBase, convert Data to another
(JSON to record) and that made me code fastar than I was used to code</p>
